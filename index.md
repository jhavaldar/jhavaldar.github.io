## Welcome

Hi! My name is Jay Havaldar, and this site is a collection of my ideas and writings about math, computer science, and music, amongst other things.

Why I created this site, its purpose was to replace a perfunctory system of handwritten notes. Since then, I've decided to use a cloud-based journaling service, [Evernote](https://https://evernote.com/) which I highly recommend. Posts here have become very scarce since I began grad school, but I'm hoping to have some more contributions in the year 2020.

This site is built using Jekyll and Github pages, and you can take a look at the [Github repository](https://github.com/jhavaldar/jhavaldar.github.io) and clone it if you want. There's also a script on the backend that automatically renders the notes into PDFs using LaTeX for downloading and printing purposes. The math is rendered using MathJax.

The site is always under construction, so check back for regular updates.

## What I've Been Up To Lately

I completed my master's degree in May 2020. I'm currently looking for roles as a data scientist, data analyst, or quantitative developer. I've been fortunate enough to get training in a wide array of topics across theoretical math and, to a lesser extent, computer science (mostly algorithms and complexity theory). Now I'd like to gain experience applying this knowledge in a hands-on environment. If you have any opportunities, feel free to [contact me](/contact).

For some miscellaneous math writing, check out my post where I look into [the surprisingly fascinating history of "the quintic equation"](/post/2017/07/02/solvable2.html). You can also check my [notes](/notes) page for some of my notes about various math topics, which I wrote to prepare for comprehensive exams (wI ended up passing Algebra, Analysis, and Geometry in August 2018). You can check out my notes [here](/notes_index).

For some writing about music, check out my[review of the new Haim album](/post/2017/07/07/something-to-tell-you.html). I also wrote a post breaking down [5 EPs you definitely haven't listened to from the first half of 2017](/post/2017/07/19/albums2017.html).

You can also check out some various other coding projects [here](/projects).
