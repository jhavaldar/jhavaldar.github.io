## Welcome!

Hi! My name is Jay Havaldar, and I'm a first year PhD student studying math. This site is a collection of my ideas and writings about math, computer science, music, and pretty much anything else.

Why I created this site: I was tired of an extremely confusing system of handwritten notes, word documents, Evernote & iPhone notes, and PDFs, so I decided to make a more sustainable solution. The first major problem with my notes is my handwriting, which isn't great and is probably getting worse (thanks, Internet). The second is my organization skills, which aren't great and are definitely getting worse.

In Spring 2017, I pretty much gave up at having any sort of "system" at all. That semester, I pretty much just carried around one tiny moleskine notebook, which contained everything from chord charts to random thoughts to de-classified notes from all my classes. I realized this actually wasn't too bad of an idea, since at least I knew where everything was. If only I could Ctrl+F my notebook...

So that's what this site is, a virtual version of my notebook, in the form of a [Github repository](https://github.com/jhavaldar/jhavaldar.github.io) for ease of use. There's also a script on the backend that automatically renders the notes into PDFs using LaTeX for downloading and printing purposes. Hopefully I'll be killing fewer trees from now on.

The site is always under construction, so check back for regular updates.

## What I've Been Up To Lately

For some miscellaneous math writing, check out my post where I look into [the surprisingly fascinating history of "the quintic equation"](2017/07/06/solvable2.html). You can also check my [notes](/notes) page for some of my notes about various math topics. Currently reading _Elementary Differential Geometry_ by Barret O'Neill. It's great.

For some writing about music, check out my post [analyzing a short chord progression in a Kendrick Lamar song](/post/2017/07/07/element.html) or my [review of the new Haim album](/post/2017/07/07/something-to-tell-you.html). More to come on that front soon.

You can also check out some various other coding projects [here](/projects). Not a whole lot there yet, but I have some ideas and luckily have some free time this summer.
