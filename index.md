title: Jay Havaldar, Math PhD Student
---

## Welcome!

Hi! My name is Jay Havaldar, and I'm a first year PhD student studying math. This site is a collection of my ideas and writings about math, computer science, music, and pretty much anything else. The site is always under construction, so check back for regular updates.

## What I've Been Up To Lately

For some miscellaneous math writing, check out my post where I prove [3 short theorems about symmetric matrices](2017/07/02/symmetric-matrices.html). You can also check my [notes](/notes) page for some of my notes about various math topics.
