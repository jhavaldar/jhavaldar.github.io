## Projects

Check out some of my projects below.

### Super Hydration Bot
A Twitter bot that reminds followers to drink a glass of water 8 times a day. Currently set to send reminders evenly between 9:30am and 11:00pm. Deployed using Heroku. Check it out at [@superhydratebot](https://twitter.com/superhydratebot) or fork it [Github](https://github.com/jhavaldar/super_hdyrate_bot).


### What Is A Third World Country?
An exploration of k-means clustering and principal component analysis with data from the World Bank. Pretty much all done in Python with some visualizations from PyPlot & D3.js.
