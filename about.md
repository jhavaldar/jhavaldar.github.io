## About Me

My name is Jay Havaldar, and I am a first-year PhD Student at UNC Chapel Hill. For undergrad, I studied at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in math and computer science. In my free time, I like to play bass, listen to music, and write code. I also like to write, and this website serves a dual purpose: a growing personal database of my knowledge and insights, as well as a means of communicating my ideas to the world.
