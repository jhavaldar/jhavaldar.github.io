## About Me

I recently completed a master's degree in mathematics at UNC Chapel Hill, with a thesis on the topic of the Bethe ansatz method. For undergrad, I studied at the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in math and computer science. In my free time, I like to play read, play bass, and write code. I also like to write, and this website serves a dual purpose: a growing personal database of my knowledge and insights, as well as a means of communicating my ideas to the world.
