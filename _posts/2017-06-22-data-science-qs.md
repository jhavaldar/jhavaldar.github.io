## Data Science Glossary

Every time I uncover a term which I don't know the meaning of, I'll log it here with a brief description of what it is. Hopefully this won't get too long...

* **Dask**:

A [parallel computing library](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) for Python. Parallelizes Numpy's Arrays and Pandas DataFrame objects, so its fairly flexible.

* **Apache Spark**

An [open source processing engine](https://databricks.com/spark/) maintained by DataBricks which is pretty impressive. First of all, there's Spark's core API, which interfaces with R, Python, SQL, Java, and Scala, as you'd expect. There's also a library which allows fast SQL queries and data frames (Spark SQL Data Frames), a library for streaming data (like from Twitter), a fast machine learning library MLib, and a graph computing library. It's actually pretty amazing.

* **Parquet**

Data format which stores tables as columns of data.
