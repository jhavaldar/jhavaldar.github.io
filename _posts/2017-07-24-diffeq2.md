# Part II: Second Order Linear Equations

We move onto second order linear differential equations.

##### Homogeneous Equations with Constant Coefficients

We have a differential equation of the form:
<p>
$$
ay'' + by' + cy = 0
$$
</p>

We could then we could use a trial solution $y= e^{rt}$, which yields the associated auxiliary equation (called the characteristic equation):

<p>
$$
ar^2 + br + c = 0
$$
</p>

Since $e^{rt} \ne 0$. Solving this yields two solutions.

First note that for a homogeneous linear equation, linear combinations of solutions yield solutions; this creates a vector space structure for the solutions as a subspace of smooth functions. In general, for a linear constant coefficient differential equation of order $n$, the subspace of solutions is dimension $n$. So we only need to construct $n$ linearly independent solutions, which we do as follows:

- For a real root, we use $e^{rt}$
- For a real root repeated with multiplicity $m$, we add $e^{rt}, te^{rt},...,t^{m-1}e^{rt}$. You can check that these are all solutions to the differential equation and are linearly independent away from $t=0$.
- For complex roots $a\pm bi$ we can write $e^{at}\cos bt, e^at\sin bt$.
- For repeated complex roots $a\pm bi$ we can write $e^{at}\cos bt, e^at\sin bt, te^{at}\cos bt, te^at\sin bt$, etcetera.

##### Reduction of Order

So how did we solve linear constant coefficient homogeneous differential equations as above in the case of a repeated root? The answer lies in the method known as reduction of order.

Suppose we have a linear differential equation of the form:
<p>
$$
y'' + p(t)y'' + q(t)y = r(t)
$$
</p>

With $p,q,r$ continuous and $r$ possibly zero. And suppose that we know some solution $y_1$ (with continuous derivative) which is never zero in an interval. Then, we can try a solution of the form $y_2=vy_1$ for some twice differentiable function $v$. Substitution and some algebra yields:

<p>
$$
v'' + (\frac{2y_1'}{y_1}+p)v' = \frac{r}{y_1}
$$
</p>

Since this is a linear first order differential equation and $y_1', p$ are assumed to be continuous, we know there is a unique solution in our interval.

Note that though we are essentially dealing with a first order differential equation for $v'$, when we integrate $v'$ we obtain an integration constant. We can WLOG write $v = \tilde{v}+c$, and thus write:
<p>
$$y_2 = \tilde{v}y_1 + cy_1$$</p>

##### Existence and Uniqueness

We need a suitable theorem guaranteeing uniqueness. The theorem goes just as we expected.
