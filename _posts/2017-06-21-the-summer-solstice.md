# The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
So the basic idea behind the fundamental theorem of calculus is that integration is the "reverse" operation of differentiation, i.e. if we have a function $f(x)$ such that $F'(x) = f(x)$, then we can say the following:

$$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = F(x) \vert_{a}^{b}$$

# Eigenvectors
Say you have a square matrix $A$. Then an eigenvector $v$ is a vector such that:

$$Av = \lambda v$$

For some scalar $\lambda$, called the **eigenvalue** associated with $v$.

> Note: For our purposes, the zero vector is not considered an eigenvector.

## Properties of matrices
- The eigenvalues of a matrix add up to the trace.
- The product of eigenvalues is the determinant.
