# Part I: First Order Differential Equations

This post will be a brief overview of first-order differential equations. I won't be focusing mainly on proofs here, but instead techniques for solving equations, as well as existence and uniqueness theorems

## Integrating Factors

Integrating factors can be used to solve first order equations of degree $1$, in other words equations of the form:

<p>
$$
y' + P(t)y = Q(t)
$$
</p>

The idea is to multiply through by a factor $\mu(t)$ suitably chosen so that the left hand side is an instance of the product rule. This integrating factor turns out to be:

<p>
$$
\mu(t) = e^{\int P(t)dt}
$$
</p>

Multiplying through, we are left with the product rule on the left hand side, yielding a new simpler differential equation:

<p>
$$
(\mu(t)y(t))' = \mu(t)Q(t)
$$
</p>

And this shouldn't be difficult to integrate in general.

## Separable Equation

A separable differential equation can be rewritten in the form:

<p>
$$
N(y)\frac{dy}{dx} = M(x)
$$
</p>

Rewriting:

<p>
$$
N(y)dy = M(x)dx
$$
</p>

Integrating both sides gives a solution for $y$.
