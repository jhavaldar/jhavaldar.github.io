# Metric Spaces

The general idea is to begin by defining the notion of convergence for arbitrary spaces.

**Definition:** A **metric space** is a set $X$ equipped with a function $d:X\times X \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ such that:
- $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x =y$ (Positive definiteness)
- $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$ (Symmetry)
- $d(x,z) \le d(x,y)+d(y,z)$. (Triangle Inequality)

We now define convergence:

**Definition:** A sequence $x_n$ converges to $x$ with respect to a metric $d$ if $\underset{n \to \infty}{\lim} d(x_n, x)$ exists and is equal to $0$.

It is not hard to check that a sequence converges in the Euclidean, taxi-cab, or sup norm metric iff each of its componenets converges.

##### Lemma

Limits are unique in a metric space.
