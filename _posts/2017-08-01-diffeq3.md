# Higher Order Linear Equations

We move onto higher order linear differential equations. As before, we need some suitable existence and uniqueness theorem which works for the general case.

## Existence and Uniqueness

In general, a linear differential equation is of the form:

<p>
$$
a_ny^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + ... + a_0y = g(t)
$$
</p>

Where $a_n$ are functions and $y^{(n)}$ represents the $n$th derivative of $y$.

##### Theorem

>Suppose we have a linear differential equation with coefficients $a_i(t)$ and right hand side equal to $g(t)$ defined in an interval $I$. Then, given $n$ initial conditions $y^{(n)}(t_0) = c_n$, there exists a unique solution to the differential equation in the interval.

Note that we already know how to solve this equation in many cases by borrowing techniques from the first two chapters:

- If the coefficients are constant and the right hand side is zero, we use the same methods as in Chapter 2.

- If the coefficients are constant and the right hand side is of a particular form, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients.

- If we know one solution, we can reduce our order $n$ equation into an order $n-1$ equation using the method of reduction of order.

Furthermore, we still know the form of a general solution of a non-homogeneous linear equation as a sum of a complementary and a particular solution; and the Wronskian can still be used to check for linear independence of solutions. The following theorem tells us that the solution space for a homogeneous equation is exactly dimension $n$.

##### Theorem

>Suppose we have an equation of the form:
><p>
$$
a_ny^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + ... + a_0y = 0
$$
></p>
>Where $a_i$ are continuous on an interval. Then, if we find $y_1,y_2,...y_n$ linearly independent solutions to the equation, then every solution can be expressed as a linear combination of $y_1,...,y_n$. 

We call such a solution set a **fundamental set of solutions**.

## Variation of Parameters

Finally, we arrive at the most important tool we have for solving a non-homogeneous $n$th order linear differential equation.

Suppose we have an equation of the form:
<p>
$$
y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + ... + a_0y = f(t)
$$
</p>

In other words, the first coefficient is $1$.

Taking the associated homogeneous equation, let $y_1,...,y_n$ be its fundamental solutions. Then we try to find a solution to the non-homogeneous equation of the form:
<p>
$$
y = u_1y_1 + u_2y_2 + ... +u_ny_n
$$
</p>

Where $u_i$ are functions.

To solve uniquely for each $u_i$, we need $n$ equations. To find them, we first take the derivative of $y$:

<p>
$$
y' = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} u_i'y_i + u_i y_i'
$$
</p>

To make things easier for us, we set the condition $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} u_i'y_i = 0$. Taking the second derivative, we get:

<p>
$$
y' = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} u_i'y_i + u_i y_i'
$$
</p>

And similarly, we set the condition $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} u_i'y_i' = 0$. Repeating this process until we hit the $n-1$th derivative, we get $n-1$ conditions. The final condition comes from substituting in our trial solution into the differential equation:

<p>
$$
y^{ (n) } + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_0y = f(t)
$$
</p>

Now substituting in $y^{(n)} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n u_iy_i^{(n)} + u_i' y_i^{(n-1)}$, we get:

<p>
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n u_iy_i^{(n)} + u_i' y_i^{(n-1)} + a_{n-1} \sum u_iy_i^{(n-1)} + ... + a_0 \sum u_iy_i = f(t)
$$
</p>

But note that for each $y_i$, since it is a solution to the associated homogeneous equation, we have:

<p>
$$
y_i^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y_i^{(n-1)} + ... + a_0y_i = 0
$$
</p>

So most of these terms drop out! The only terms that remain give us:

<p>
$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n u_i' y_i^{(n-1)} = f(t)
$$
</p>

To summarize, our conditions look like:

<p>
$$\begin{aligned}
u_1' y_1 + ... + u_1'y_n &= 0 \\
u_1' y_1' + ... + u_1'y_n' &= 0 \\
\vdots \\
u_1' y_1^{(n-1)} + ... + u_1'y_n^{(n-1)} &= f(t)
\end{aligned}$$
</p>

And to put this in matrix form:

<p>
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
f_1 && ... && f_n \\
\vdots && \ddots && \vdots \\
f_1^{n-1} && ... && f_n^{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1 \\
\vdots \\
u_n
\end{bmatrix}'
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\vdots \\
f(t)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>

So, as long as $W \ne 0$, we can solve for $u_i'$ and thus integrate to find $u_i$.

##### Summary of Method

Suppose we have an equation of the form:
<p>
$$
y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + ... + a_0y = f(t)
$$
</p>

Where we have a set of fundamental solutions $y_i$ to the associated homogeneous equation. Then, we can write a solution as:

<p>
$$
y = u_1 y_1 + ... + u_n y_n
$$
</p>

Where $u_i$ are found by solving the equation:

<p>
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
f_1 && ... && f_n \\
\vdots && \ddots && \vdots \\
f_1^{n-1} && ... && f_n^{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1 \\
\vdots \\
u_n
\end{bmatrix}'
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\vdots \\
f(t)
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</p>
